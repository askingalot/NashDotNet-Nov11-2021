# Coding Challenges arenâ€™t just for terrifying interviews!

We'll solve some simple, common coding challenges in C# 10.

The challenges we'll tackle are listed here: https://github.com/askingalot/NashDotNet-Nov11-2021/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen

## The Plan

1. Pick a challenge from the list
1. Work through it the way we might in an interviews
1. Discuss alternative approaches and/or other interesting things that come up
1. Make things interesting by adding an interesting constraint to the challenge
1. Repeat

## Speak UP!

This will be super boring if I do all the talking. We need your input.

* Do you have other ideas for challenges? Add an issue to this repo so we can keep track
* Do you have an idea for a different approach to solve the problem?
* Do you have an idea for a constraint?
* Am I making a terrible mistake? **PLEASE STOP ME!**

## Interesting Constraints

What do I mean by "interesting constraint"? I just mean unusual rules we'll set for ourselves to see how they affect our coding

### Some examples

* No `if` statements
* No loops
* No variables

## My tools

_No, I'm not using Visual Studio 2022 tonight_

1. Pop!_OS Linux (an Ubuntu derivative from System76)
1. Neovim with coc.vim and omnisharp
    * This uses the same "Language Server Protocol" that VS Code uses
    * I'm still getting to know some of these tools since I've been mostly using Visual Studio and VS Cdoe for the past few years
1. .NET 6 and C# 10
    * I'm not sure how many C# 10 features we'll see, but they're there if we need them
